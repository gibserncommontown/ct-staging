The Forum served as a platform for the sharing of ideas and positive teaching practices among teachers. The Forum was held at the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) Lecture Theatre.<br><br>The Forum was targeted at Chinese teachers who are currently using the Dudu system. The Forum furnished these teachers with valuable information on how to effectively use learning analytics to identify students' strengths and challenges in reading comprehension, and how to use that to help each student improve his/her reading comprehension ability.&nbsp;<br><br>The key speaker of the forum is Dr Tan Chee Lay, Deputy Director of SCCL. Dr Tan's talk gave insights into how teachers can facilitate students' learning of the Chinese language, as well as how to use Dudu to analyse students' reading abilities. On behalf of the CommonTown research team, Joel Loo, CEO of CommonTown, also shed light on the background of Dudu, and how Dudu started.&nbsp;<br><br>It was an enjoyable session for all the participants of the Forum, and CommonTown looks forward to organising more of such events in the future!<br><br>\n<table class=\"ive_eobj_center ives_tab_kosong\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 336px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/Dudu Forum/IMG_5459.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5459.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 329px; height: 246px;\">\n</th>\n<th style=\"width: 337px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/Dudu Forum/IMG_5462.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5462.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 329px; height: 246px;\">\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 60px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/Dudu Forum/IMG_5466.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5466.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 329px; height: 246px;\">\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 60px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/Dudu Forum/IMG_5474.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5474.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 328px; height: 246px;\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>"}],"d_crumbs":[{"text":"News","to":"/news"},{"text":"2016","to":"/news/2016"},{"text":"Feb: 阅读大追踪 - 适性化电子阅读崭新策略","to":"/news/2016/feb-dudu-forum"}],"aside_items":[{"title":"Nov: EdTechxAsia 2016","to":"/news/2016/nov-edtechxasia-2016","child":[]},{"title":"Sep: Early Childhood Conference 2016","to":"/news/2016/sep-early-childhood-conference-2016","child":[]},{"title":"May: Awarded Web Contractor for CWP Tender","to":"/news/2016/may-awarded-web-contractor-for-cwp-tender","child":[]},{"title":"Apr: AWS Education Cloud Day","to":"/news/2016/apr-aws-education-cloud-day","child":[]},{"title":"Mar: iCTLT 2016","to":"/news/2016/mar-ictlt-2016","child":[]},{"title":"Mar: Opening of My First Skool at Waterway Point","to":"/news/2016/mar-opening-of-my-first-skool-at-waterway-point","child":[]},{"title":"Feb: Wheelock College-Singapore Career Fair","to":"/news/2016/feb-wheelock-college-career-fair","child":[]},{"title":"Feb: 阅读大追踪 - 适性化电子阅读崭新策略","to":"/news/2016/feb-dudu-forum","child":[]},{"title":"Jan: Bett Show 2016","to":"/news/2016/jan-bett-show-2016","child":[]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
