Through this event, we were glad to have been able to reach out to Chinese teachers in Singapore and introduce Dudu to them. We received very encouraging feedback with regards to Dudu's features, and we are heartened by the enthusiastic response that we have received from our booth visitors.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\nWe are honoured to have been a part of this exhibition, alongside other educational technology companies such as Google for Education, and Marshall Cavendish. We look forward to the 6th installment of iCTLT.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor more information about iCTLT 2016, click&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://ictlt.com/about_ictlt\" target=\"_blank\">\n  here\n</a>\n.\n<br>\n<br>\n    \n  \n<table class=\"ive_eobj_center ives_tab_kosong\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 336px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/iCTLT 2016/ictlt2016/IMG_5765.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5765.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 328px; height: 246px;\"> \n</th>\n<th style=\"width: 337px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/iCTLT 2016/ictlt2016/IMG_5766.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5766.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 329px; height: 246px;\"> \n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 60px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/iCTLT 2016/ictlt2016/IMG_5771.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5771.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 329px; height: 246px;\"> \n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 60px;\"><img src=\"https://commontown3.commonwork.net/qws/slot/u50147/CT_news/iCTLT 2016/ictlt2016/IMG_5775.JPG\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"IMG_5775.JPG\" class=\"ive_eobj_left\" style=\"width: 330px; height: 247px;\"> \n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>"}],"d_crumbs":[{"text":"News","to":"/news"},{"text":"2016","to":"/news/2016"},{"text":"Mar: iCTLT 2016","to":"/news/2016/mar-ictlt-2016"}],"aside_items":[{"title":"Nov: EdTechxAsia 2016","to":"/news/2016/nov-edtechxasia-2016","child":[]},{"title":"Sep: Early Childhood Conference 2016","to":"/news/2016/sep-early-childhood-conference-2016","child":[]},{"title":"May: Awarded Web Contractor for CWP Tender","to":"/news/2016/may-awarded-web-contractor-for-cwp-tender","child":[]},{"title":"Apr: AWS Education Cloud Day","to":"/news/2016/apr-aws-education-cloud-day","child":[]},{"title":"Mar: iCTLT 2016","to":"/news/2016/mar-ictlt-2016","child":[]},{"title":"Mar: Opening of My First Skool at Waterway Point","to":"/news/2016/mar-opening-of-my-first-skool-at-waterway-point","child":[]},{"title":"Feb: Wheelock College-Singapore Career Fair","to":"/news/2016/feb-wheelock-college-career-fair","child":[]},{"title":"Feb: 阅读大追踪 - 适性化电子阅读崭新策略","to":"/news/2016/feb-dudu-forum","child":[]},{"title":"Jan: Bett Show 2016","to":"/news/2016/jan-bett-show-2016","child":[]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
