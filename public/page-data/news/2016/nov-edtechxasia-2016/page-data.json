Joel’s talk, titled “<b>Leveraging the power of adaptive learning: Accelerating Chinese Language learning</b>”, touched on the technologies and framework behind the Dudu Personalised Learning System, introducing the various theories and research tools that went into the development of this adaptive system. During the talk, there were discussions with regards to the scalability of the technologies behind the Dudu system to cover other different languages besides Chinese.
