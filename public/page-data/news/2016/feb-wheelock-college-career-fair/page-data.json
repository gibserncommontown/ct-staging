However, Ms. Stephanie Ng, Educationist at CommonTown, and a Wheelock College-Singapore alumni herself, cleared this misconception for her juniors at the career fair. &nbsp;For the graduating cohort, speaking to their senior and learning about her experiences with working in CommonTown was an eye-opener, and many of them were not only excited, but also open to the idea of working in an industry where their ECE degree is applicable outside of a preschool.<br><br>To find out more about Ms Ng's experiences, click <a href=\"http://singapore.wheelock.edu/2016/02/alumni-spotlight-stephanie-ng-on-helping-schools-to-become-more-tech-savvy-and-efficient/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!<br><br>"}],"d_crumbs":[{"text":"News","to":"/news"},{"text":"2016","to":"/news/2016"},{"text":"Feb: Wheelock College-Singapore Career Fair","to":"/news/2016/feb-wheelock-college-career-fair"}],"aside_items":[{"title":"Nov: EdTechxAsia 2016","to":"/news/2016/nov-edtechxasia-2016","child":[]},{"title":"Sep: Early Childhood Conference 2016","to":"/news/2016/sep-early-childhood-conference-2016","child":[]},{"title":"May: Awarded Web Contractor for CWP Tender","to":"/news/2016/may-awarded-web-contractor-for-cwp-tender","child":[]},{"title":"Apr: AWS Education Cloud Day","to":"/news/2016/apr-aws-education-cloud-day","child":[]},{"title":"Mar: iCTLT 2016","to":"/news/2016/mar-ictlt-2016","child":[]},{"title":"Mar: Opening of My First Skool at Waterway Point","to":"/news/2016/mar-opening-of-my-first-skool-at-waterway-point","child":[]},{"title":"Feb: Wheelock College-Singapore Career Fair","to":"/news/2016/feb-wheelock-college-career-fair","child":[]},{"title":"Feb: 阅读大追踪 - 适性化电子阅读崭新策略","to":"/news/2016/feb-dudu-forum","child":[]},{"title":"Jan: Bett Show 2016","to":"/news/2016/jan-bett-show-2016","child":[]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
