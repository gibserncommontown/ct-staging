Reading comprehension skills (e.g.,\n    skills that help children understand facts, organize ideas, make comparisons\n    and predictions) can be developed in children through practice. These reading\n    skills support creative thinking, which is the novel connection of ideas or\n    concepts in our minds, through thought-stimulating activities such as the use\n    of rich illustrations that stimulate children’s curiosity and active\n    imagination to interpret the images and movement activities to let children\n    acquire meanings of words through multiple modalities. This paper introduces a\n    Chinese reading comprehension program that incorporates learning materials to\n    stimulate children’s imagination as well as improve their Chinese literacy\n    skills. It also details the SECURe framework to help teachers prepare for\n    lessons and evaluate children improvements.\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n"}],"d_crumbs":[{"text":"News","to":"/news"},{"text":"2015","to":"/news/2015"},{"text":"Apr: Distinguished Paper Award","to":"/news/2015/apr-distinguished-paper-award"}],"aside_items":[{"title":"Nov: Dudu's New Look","to":"/news/2015/nov-dudus-new-look","child":[]},{"title":"Nov: Media Exploits 2015","to":"/news/2015/nov-media-exploits-2015","child":[]},{"title":"Nov: Singapore Publishing Symposium 2015","to":"/news/2015/nov-singapore-publishing-symposium-2015","child":[]},{"title":"Oct: Successful Roll-out of Qoqolo to NFC","to":"/news/2015/oct-successful-roll-out-of-qoqolo-to-ntuc-first-campus","child":[]},{"title":"Oct: A New Look for Qoqolo's Website","to":"/news/2015/oct-a-new-look-for-qoqolos-website","child":[]},{"title":"Sep: Qoqolo at PCF Leaders' Forum!","to":"/news/2015/sep-qoqolo-at-pcf-leaders-forum","child":[]},{"title":"Jul: Civil Service College ULMS","to":"/news/2015/jul-civil-service-college-ulms","child":[]},{"title":"Apr: Distinguished Paper Award","to":"/news/2015/apr-distinguished-paper-award","child":[]},{"title":"Jan: New Product Launch - Dudu","to":"/news/2015/jan-new-product-launch-dudu","child":[]},{"title":"Jan: E-Marketing talk at MIS event 2015","to":"/news/2015/jan-e-marketing-talk-at-mis-event-2015","child":[]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
